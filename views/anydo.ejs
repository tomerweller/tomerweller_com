    <h3>The Company</h3>
    <p>
        Any.do is a family of apps designed to help have a good day, every day. The team started with solving the
        problem
        of day to day productivity with the Any.do to-do list. In less than a year, Any.do has become the most popular
        task
        management app on mobile. The app currently helps millions in getting more organized while feeling satisfied
        with
        their everyday life. In June of 2013 the company has announced itâ€™s next product: Cal - a simple, fun and
        surprisingly clever
        calendar app.

    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>
        In 2013 I joined the company's Android team as a <b>Senior Mobile Developer</b>. <br/>
        In addition to the on-going development on the Any.do to-do list we began the research & development effort to
        build "Cal" for Android. Cal is developed using modern agile methodology - fast iterations and release cycles.
        It uses the most advanced open source tools and frameworks available for modern apps development.
        <br/>
        Cal has a unique user interface, unlike any other mobile application. As such, most UI elements are custom and
        built from scratch.
        <br/><br/>
        Cal is currently being beta tested and will soon be released.
