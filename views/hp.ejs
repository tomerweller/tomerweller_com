    <h3>My Role</h3>
    <p>In 2010 I began working with the CMDB PCoE (Performance Center of Excellence) team as a student. The team's
        responsability is the overall performance of the group's products. It does so using the following
        methodology:</p>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Understand the client environment in which the product will run: IT capabilities, data
            characteristics, work load and most importantly, performance requirements.</li>
        <li>Build the tools needed to simulate this enviornment</li>
        <li>Run a load simulation using these tools while monitoring performance.</li>
        <li>Find performance bottlenecks and get to the root cause in collaboration with the appropriate developers</li>
    </ol>
